Version 1.1 - 10/05/2013
================================================================================
*Changed interface a lot and transitioned from jQuery-UI to Twitter Bootstrap


Version 1.0 - 09/20/2013
================================================================================
*Working first version


What is it?
================================================================================
A webpage that lets you find all the Wafels & Dinges located in New York, USA
and get directions to any of the locations of your choosing, or better yet,
the closest one! The goal is to make this somewhat mobile-friendly so you
can locate on the go.


Wafels & Dinges? What ever could that be?
================================================================================
Originally started as a food truck and now evolved to carts, trucks, and a
cafe, they serve up only the best Belgian waffles, nay, waffles period! 


Why did you make this? Are you getting paid for this?
================================================================================
I don't currently live in New York, but I plan to in the near future. Almost
every time I head down to NYC, I have to get my Belgian waffle fix. And every
time, I have trouble figuring out where to get it. Due to the nature of food
trucks and their ever-changing locales, Wafels & Dinges posts their locations
on Twitter. Not being a local, this makes it confusing and difficult for me 
to get to my waffle. 

Additionally, their website is not mobile-phone friendly and it doesn't give 
directions. What location do I want? Which one is closest to me?

And of course, this lets me play around with JavaScript, jQuery, and some
neat APIs like YQL and Google Maps.

I am in no way affiliated with Wafels & Dinges. I am merely an avid admirer
of their fantastic product. This little app is mostly for personal convenience,
fun and enjoyment. 


Possible todos:
*Minimize the network requests and data (e.g. remove the need for jQuery, 
 jQuery UI, etc.)
*Make it more sleek and stylish for mobile
*Evaluate autocomplete Geocoding for start address (and add it if feasible)
*Cache more stuff in LocalStorage if possible
*Modularize the PlotterModule more, allowing for possible reuse in other
*mashups in the future
*Any number of user interface tweaks...
*Refactor, refactor, refactor
